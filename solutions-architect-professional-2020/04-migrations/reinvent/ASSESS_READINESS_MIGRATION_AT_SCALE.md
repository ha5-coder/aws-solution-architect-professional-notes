# How to Assess Your Organization's Readiness to Migrate at Scale

**You will be successful if you are committed!**

## Common Migration Drivers (500+)

- Agility/Dev productivity
- Digitial transformation
- Facility or real-estate decisions
- Acquisisitions or divestitures
- Operational evolution
- Cost reduction
- Data center consolidation
- Large scale compute intensive workloads
- colocation or outsourcing contract changes

## Migration Readiness

- Executive sponsorship - Sr leadership
- Business case - Base on the migration drivers we want to migrate to the cloud 
- People - creating a framework for people to grow, most problems are people and process. Focus on training and mobilizing team.
- Foundational experience - people who get hands on AWS have a much higher rate of success. People fully understand the value of AWS.
- Visibility - Insight and knowledge around what your IT portfolio looks like.
- Operating model - What hoops do you have to jump through to get a change done.

## Executive Sponsorship

- Formulate and evangelize strategy
- Layout communication plan - if we move to the cloud what happens to certain jobs
- Support communication channels
- Create new roles and learning paths
- Realign priorities and allocate resources

- Create a framework for measuring success (KPI focused)
- Form strong coalition of leaders across the org
- Reinforce commitment and reward early wins

**Commit, build, and maintain momentum!**

Most of the time when projects stall it's because people don't know what their job is.

## Business Case

- Directional - General idea, data center
- Refined - We have 2000 vms in the data center and would like to BYOL
- Detailed - We would like to retire 200, platform 300, and retain 200...

## People

The people at the end of the day decide whether you are successful or not.

- Training - build technical skills and learn best practices online or with accredited instructor
- Self-paced online labs - to learn AWS services and practices skills at low cost 
- AWS Certification - to validate knowledge with an industry recognized credential

Other options: AWS Solution Architects Immersion Days and AWS Professional Services Workshops

- Create Center of Excellence og chart - best to have people that understand the culture that are a part of this.
- Define RACI matrix for initial migration waves from discovery to operations - who is a good fit for the migration team
- Skills assessment
- New internal job descriptions

## Foundation Experience

Ensure that the people at the table understand what is going on. What the differences between the 6 R's etc.

## Operating Models

What are your operating models and how will you address changes in a hybrid mode?

What are the main tools processes employed today?

What operational capabilities do you need to ramp up that align to the vision?

3 Different Models

- Traditional
    - Go to different teams to get stuff done
- Automated Efficiency - Some on prep operations, but alot more automation involved
- DevOps - you build it you own it

You can be any of these models, but it has to work for your organization. **Figure out what model you want before you do any large scale migration.**

## Visibility

Automated service discovery **always**

Understand support models, OS, platforms, etc.

Once you have visibility get a good understanding of the 6 R's.

- Retain
- Retire
- Rehost
- Replatform
- Refactor
- Repurchase
