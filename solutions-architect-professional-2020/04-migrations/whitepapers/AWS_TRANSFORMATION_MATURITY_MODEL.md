# AWS Cloud Transformation Maturity Model

https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/AWS-Cloud-Transformation-Maturity-Model.pdf

This model is used to assess the maturity of cloud adoption through four key stages:

- Project
- Foundation
- Migration
- Optimization

## Project Stage

**Getting through this stage is crucial to cloud success.** During this stage organizations usually have limited knowledge of cloud services and potential costs and benefits.

### Challenges and Barriers

- Limited Knowledge and training
- Executive support and funding - This is a hard sell due to IT infrastructure investments as a **necessary  evil** and don't often want to make another investment into IT especially when there have been poor service deliver and failing project implementations.
- Purchasing public cloud services - This can be hard for companies that have never negotiated purchasing paradigms for cloud services.
- Limited confidence in cloud service models
- IT ownership and direction

### Transformation Activities

- Contact an AWS account manager - this person can connect you with AWS Partners and professional services to address all of your AWS needs. [See Contact Us](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/)
- Raise the level of AWS awareness
    - AWS Business Essentials - This is for IT leaders
    - Online Videos and hands-on labs
        - https://www.aws.training/
        - https://www.qwiklabs.com/
        - https://www.youtube.com/user/AmazonWebServices
    - AWS Technical Essentials - https://aws.amazon.com/training/course-descriptions/essentials/
    - AWS Whitepapers
    - AWS Trainings
- Secure executive support and funding - Use cases studies and cost and value modeling workshops
- Consider purchasing options
    - Directly from AWS
    - Indirect through AWS Partners
- Execute a pilot or POCS project
- Conduct an IT Transformation Workshop - shows how to replace uncertainty in the cloud with vision and strategy on how to derive value from AWS.

### Outcomes and Maturity

The following measure readiness to move to foundation stage:

- Effective use of AWS resources - AWS Professional Services, onsite presentations and meetings, onsite training, web service accounts, and support.
- Knowledgeable and trained organization - IT Leadership is familiar with AWS, costs and benefits, and transformation best practices.
- Executive support and funding
- Ability to purchase AWS and AWS professional services
- IT staff confidence and true buy-in
- Central IT ownership and a clear transformation roadmap

## Foundation Stage

Environment has been assessed, all agreements are in place, and plan is created for the migration.

### Challenges and Barriers

- Assigning transformation support resources
- Providing leadership through a transformation plan - This should be lead differently depending on the organization's leadership. There should possibly be architecture and developers involved.
- Integrating security and compliance policies
- Managing cost and budget

### Transformation Activities

- Establish a Cloud Center of Excellence
- Develop security and compliance architecture
- Develop a value management plan

### Outcomes and Maturity

- CCoE providing the following benefits:
    - Standardizations of strategy and vision
    - Centralized expertise
    - Standardization of technical processes and procedures
    - Bias for action
- Clear transformation roadmap
- Best practice security and compliance architecture
- Strong value managment plan

## Migration Stage

This is where the organization matures overall and effectively migrates targeted applications.

### Challenges and Barriers

- Developing an effective and efficient migration strategy
- Implementing a robust migration process
- Setting up a cloud environment - this environment is controlled, sustainable, reliable, and enables improved agility
- Going all-in

### Transformation Activities

- Conduct a portfolio assessment - focusing on the 6 R's
    - Re-factoring
    - Re-platforming
    - Re-purchasing
    - Re-hosting
    - Retiring
    - Retaining
- Implement a migration environment
- Implement a best-management environment - account(s) for access, security, compliance, and automation
- Migrate targeted workloads

### Outcomes and Maturity

- All in with AWS
- IT as a Service - you can now measure cost savings, agility, and innovation

## Optimization Stage

You have successfully migrated all targeted applications into AWS and you are now in an ongoing loop of optimization.

### Challenges and Barriers

- Optimize Costs
- Optimize operation services - improving automation and continuous delivery
- Optimize application services - improve application services that you use to build and enhance applications
- Optimize enterprise services - constantly seek SaaS based offerings, as opposed to hosted solutions

### Transformation Activities

- Implement a continuous cost optimization process
- Implement a continuous operation management optimization process
- Implement a continuous application service optimization
    - API Gateway
    - AppStream 2.0
    - Elasticsearch Service
- Implement continuous enterprise service optimization process
    - Amazon WorkSpaces
    - Amazon WorkDocs
    - Amazon WorkMail

### Outcomes and Maturity

- Optimized cost savings
- Optimized operations management process
- Optimized application development process
- Optimized enterprise services
